#  Description

Good! You now have a basic translation app that works well. Wouldn’t it be great though to expand it and include all available languages? This will add the ability to translate from/to any language in the list.

The maximum number of languages our translator can support is 13. They are:

-    Arabic
-    German
-    English
-    Spanish
-    French
-    Hebrew
-    Japanese
-    Dutch
-    Polish
-    Portuguese
-    Romanian
-    Russian
-    Turkish

They should be enumerated in the program. A great idea is to present them with relevant numbers, so that the user can choose the first as the original language and the second as a translation.

Tip: just place the listed languages into the URL depending on the user’s choice!

Tip-2: Try to convert the input to lower case: it may cause an error if the user's input is in upper case or mixed. You can do it with Python's built-in functionality.
#  Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
